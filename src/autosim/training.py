It is useful if the gene space is restricted to a certain range or to discrete values. It accepts a list, range, or numpy.ndarray. When all genes have the same global space, specify their values as a list/tuple/range/numpy.ndarray. For example, gene_space = [0.3, 5.2, -4, 8] restricts the gene values to the 4 specified values. If each gene has its own space, then the gene_space parameter can be nested like [[0.4, -5], [0.5, -3.2, 8.2, -9], ...] where the first sublist determines the values for the first gene, the second sublist for the second gene, and so on. If the nested list/tuple has a None value, then the geneâ€™s initial value is selected randomly from the range specified by the 2 parameters init_range_low and init_range_high and its mutation value is selected randomly from the range specified by the 2 parameters random_mutation_min_val and random_mutation_max_val. gene_space is added in PyGAD 2.5.0. Check the Release History of PyGAD 2.5.0 section of the documentation for more details. In PyGAD 2.9.0, NumPy arrays can be assigned to the gene_space parameter. In PyGAD 2.11.0, the gene_space parameter itself or any of its elements can be assigned to a dictionary to specify the lower and upper limits of the genes. For example, {'low': 2, 'high': 4} means the minimum and maximum values are 2 and 4, respectively.

An example for reach is "reach_40" which stops the evolution if the fitness is >= 40. saturate means stop the evolution if the fitness saturates for a given number of consecutive generations. An example for saturate is "saturate_7" which means stop the run() method if the fitness does not change for 7 consecutive generations.
